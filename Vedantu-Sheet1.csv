User: Can you clarify on Electromagnetic Induction ?

Bot:  Electromagnetic Induction EMI occurs when an electromotive force emf is induced in a circuit due to a change in the magnetic flux linked with the circuit The magnetic flux, represented as Φ  BA cosθ, can be altered by changing:
i The magnitude of the magnetic field B
ii The area A of the region, which can be done by shrinking, stretching, or modifying the coil's shape
iii The angle θ between the magnetic field B and the normal to the surface area A, thereby modifying their relative orientation

According to Faraday's second law, the induced emf is given by e  -dΦ/dt The integral form of Faraday's laws of EMI is expressed as ∫Ein⋅dl  -dΦ/dt",,,,,,,,30%,Yet to be transferred,,

Bot:  The magnetic flux associated with an area placed in a magnetic field is equal to the total number of magnetic lines of force passing naturally through that area It is represented by the formula Net flux through the surface   ∮ B ⋅ dA  BA cosθ, where θ is the angle between the area vector and the magnetic field vector If θ  0, then   BA, and if θ  90°, then   0 Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity Its SI unit is weber wb, and the CGS unit is Maxwell or Gauss·cm² One weber is equal to 10^8 Maxwell Other units include N·m²/Amp, Joule/Amp, Volt·Coulomb/Amp, Tesla·m², Volt·sec, Ohm·Coulomb, and Henry·Amp Its dimensional formula is ML²T⁻²A⁻¹


Bot:  I do not have information on that in my knowledge base Please refer to https://wwwvedantucom/ved-ai for more clarifications


Bot:  Faraday's Laws of Emi:
i First law: An induced emf is formed in a circuit whenever the number of magnetic lines of force magnetic flux travelling through it changes The induced emf lasts only as long as the flux is changing or being cut
ii Second law: The induced emf is calculated from the rate of change of magnetic flux, represented as e  -dφ/dt, which is known as the integral form of Faraday's laws of EMI",Grade 10,Academic Doubts,,,,,,,,2025-12-20T09:18:31.818+05:30,
